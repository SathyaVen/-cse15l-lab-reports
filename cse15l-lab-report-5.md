# Lab Report 5
* I searched through the tests with different results manually in order to find the differing outputs
* All expected links are according to common mark

## Test #1 548.md
* The output for my implmentation is shown below

* The output for the provided implementation is shown below

* The expected output is `/uri`. Both implementations are incorect.
* The bug in my implementation is that the method throws an illegal argument exception when its not supposed to. This happens on line 27, where the value of openBracket is -1, and thus the line evaluates. See the image below

* The expected output is again `/uri`. Both implementations are incorect.
